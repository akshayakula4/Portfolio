## About Me

As a Data Engineer at PayPal, I build and maintain data pipelines, data lakes, and dashboards using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and coordinate tasks among the team. I also design and implement star schema in Big Query and use g-cloud functions with Python to load data from Google Cloud Storage (GCS) buckets. I have experience in migrating on-prem Hadoop systems to GCP and using cloud Dataflow, Dataproc, and Bigtable for big data processing.

I have a Master's degree in Computer Science from University of Central Missouri, where I learned the fundamentals of data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. Before joining PayPal, I worked as a Data Engineer at Marsh McLennan and Virtusa, where I designed and developed data architectures and ETL processes using AWS, Snowflake, Airflow, and PySpark. I also developed Tableau and Google Looker reports and dashboards for data visualization and analysis. I have multiple certifications in Google Cloud, SQL, and Confluence, and I have won several awards for my performance and innovation. I am passionate about learning new technologies and trends in the data science and AI field, and I enjoy mentoring, working, and learning from some of the best and brightest analytical minds and data scientists in the business.

## Professional Experience

In my eight years as a Data Engineer, I’ve cultivated a deep passion for data architecture, data management, ETL processes, and data analysis. My journey began at Etouch systems, where I honed my skills in writing complex SQL Queries, data visualization using Power BI and SQL. I excelled in utilizing MS Excel for complex data analysis, delivering actionable insights that resulted in a 90% client satisfaction rate.

My Data Engineer experience at Virtusa & Marsh McLennan was a pivotal experience in my career. I applied Agile methodologies to enhance ETL pipelines using Informatica, Spark, and Scala, reducing data processing errors by 50%. Additionally, I contributed to bolstering data security through Python scripts. My proficiency in cloud engineering, AWS EMR Glue Jobs and Power BI helped increase operational efficiency by 40%, as I played a key role in optimizing data workflows and integration strategies.

Currently, as a Data Architect & Data Engineer at Paypal, I oversee the data infrastructure to ensure seamless data management and processing. My role involves creating and managing automated data import/export jobs, optimizing databases with Big query, writing complex queries, and generating reports using Looker studio. I also design data pipelines end to end based on data requirement to meet internal business needs. I have experience in migrating on-prem Hadoop systems to GCP and using cloud Dataflow, Dataproc, and Bigtable for big data processing. Additionally, I integrate data from external APIs, leverage data modeling techniques, and contribute to database performance enhancements through monitoring and backup strategies, ensuring reliability and scalability.

## Projects

### [Exploratory Data Analysis of Car]

<!-- (https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/3dtvuexqvhopdfrbvt7ke/Store_prediction_model.pdf?rlkey=sfg0ewecb7g05okwevy0140wb&dl=0) -->

- I focused on data pre-processing to ensure the dataset was accurately formatted and ready for analysis. I conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to investigate the relationships between various car features and their market prices. Utilizing the "Car Features and MSRP" dataset from Kaggle, which encompasses nearly 12,000 car models sold in the USA from 1990 to 2017, I applied descriptive statistics and visualizations to uncover hidden insights and trends in the data, including both new and used market prices. This project enhanced my ability to extract valuable information from complex datasets and informed decision-making processes in the automotive domain.

### Library management system

- A Library Management System (LMS) is a web-based application designed to effectively manage library resources and services. For frontend development, HTML is utilized for the structure of web pages, CSS for styling and layout, and JavaScript for dynamic and interactive features such as search functionality and user authentication. On the backend, PHP serves as the server-side programming language that creates dynamic web pages, facilitating user authentication, data processing, and database connectivity. The system employs SQL as its database management solution, which manages the relational database containing information on books, borrowers, transactions, and more.

### Exchequer

- Contributed to software development in an Agile team, implementing features in Java and C/C++.
- Performed unit and integration testing to ensure feature reliability and collaborated in code reviews.
- Used Git for version control and collaborated across multi-site teams to troubleshoot issues and enhance system functionality.

## Publications
